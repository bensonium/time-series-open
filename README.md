Retail Sales Forecasting is a fascinating (and profitable) problem to work on, but without using client proprietary data, it can be a challenge to share your work. The benefits of accurate sales forecasting don't stop at accurate stock and staffing levels - cash flow, risk management, pricing strategy, business growth and expansion are all influenced. In this project, the process of EDA, transformation and encoding is looked at. Linear Regression is used to capture as much of the seasonality in the data as possible before it is hybridised with an XGBoost regressor to produce a model with a R2 of 0.926 on the test set.
